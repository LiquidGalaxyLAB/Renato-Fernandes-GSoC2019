## Proposal

Javascript library to acquire and display data from sensors

Here you can find how to operate the **server** methods, to see the library methods see [this page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/liquidsensors)

----
This repo contains two main folders:

**Server**
This folder contains a default implementation of the main library, containing a node server ready to go. 
It implements a lot of premade code for your application.
Also, a frontend app is being developed for this particular implementation [here](https://github.com/RenatoFernandesTotti/Renato-Fernandes-GSoC2019-FrontEndApp)

**npmPkg**
Here you can find all of the library code.
